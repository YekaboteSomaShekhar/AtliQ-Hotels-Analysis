# AtliQ-Hotels-Analysis
This project is based on Python (Pandas) for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

## Project Overview

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze historical hotel booking data to improve occupancy rates, revenue growth, and market share for AtliQ Grands. Using Python (Pandas) in Jupyter Notebook, the project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
This project helps AtliQ Grands leverage business intelligence and data analytics to regain its competitive edge in the hospitality industry.
